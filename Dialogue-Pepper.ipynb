The code of the service will analyse the level of sound intensity and, based on the parameters in the code below, decide when start recording and when stopping, creating the audio file. <br>\n",
    "NOTE: since the robot cannot process the recognition, but just the amount of noise in the environment this is a [really challenging problem of turn-taking.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turn-taking) <br>\n",
    "Be careful changing the parameters because it could happen that the audio file is stopped too early for a long pause in the speech, or on the opposite, the audio file is stopped after the initial silence cause it has been detected that nobody is speaking.\n",
